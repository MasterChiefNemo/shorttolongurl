# Tiny URL to Long Form URL
The idea of this Java project is to convert from short (tiny) to long (full) urls. The purpose is to allow everyone to remain safe and aware of what links they are clicking.

Full credit to Thomas Tasche, https://gist.github.com/TomTasche/1104272 for creating the original Short to Long URL expander. I've simply added additional exception handling, and converted the gist into an eclipse project.
